    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p> Welcome to my website! My name is Kevin Wander, and I'm a junior computer science major at Hunter College. I'm a dedicated and motivated individual with a passion for technology & programming. I've been committed to excellence in my academic career & I am seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. At hunter I've been taught C++ & data structure and I have learned python & Kotlin on my own time. Finding creative solutions to technical challenges sounds very interesting and I would love to collaborate effectively with colleagues on group projects. Please take a look & feel free to contact me if you have any questions. </p>
